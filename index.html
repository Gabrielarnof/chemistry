  <h1>CHEMISTRY</h1>
  <p>You might think of chemistry only in the context of lab tests, food additives or dangerous substances, but the field of chemistry involves everything around us,Everything you hear, see, smell, taste, and touch involves chemistry and chemicals (matter)," according to the American Chemical Society(opens in new tab) (ACS).<p>

    <p>Chemistry is the study of matter, analysing its structure, properties and behaviour to see what happens when they change in chemical reactions. As such, it can be considered a branch of physical science, alongside astronomy, physics and earth sciences including geology. 
    An important area of chemistry is the understanding of atoms and what determines how they react. It turns out reactivity is often largely mediated by the electrons that orbit atoms and the way these are exchanged and shared to create chemical bonds.</p>

    <h3>Inorganic Chemistry</h3>
        <p> Inorganic chemistry is concerned with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds. This includes all the remaining elements in the periodic table  and some compounds of carbon (such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2)), which plays a major role in many inorganic compounds. Thus, inorganic chemistry is the subcategory of chemistry concerned with the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds, which includes all chemical compounds without the chains or rings of carbon atoms that fall into the subcategory of organic compounds.</p>
    <p><h4>Where is inorganic chemistry used?</p></h4>
<p>Inorganic compounds are used as catalysts, pigments, coatings, surfactants, medicines, fuels, and more. They often have high melting points and specific high or low electrical conductivity properties, which make them useful for specific purposes.</p> 
  <p><h4> What do inorganic chemists do?</p></h4>
    <p>Inorganic chemists are employed in fields ranging from mining to microchips. Their work is based on understanding: The behavior and analogues for inorganic elements, and how these materials can be modified, separated, and used.  Specific work may include:  Developing methods to recover metals from waste streams.Inorganic chemists who work in government say their time is increasingly spent writing grant proposals and competing for research money.</p>

      <h3>Organic Chemistry</h3>
    <p> Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds. Most organic compounds contain carbon and hydrogen, but they may also include any number of other elements (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, sulfur). Originally limited to the study of compounds produced by living organisms, organic chemistry has been broadened to include human-made substances (e.g., plastics).r.</p>
    
    <p><h4> What do organic chemists do?</p></h4>
    <p>Organic chemistry is a highly creative science that allows chemists to create and explore molecules and compounds. Organic chemists spend much of their time developing new compounds and finding better ways of synthesizing existing ones.</p>

    <h3>Physical Chemistry</h3>
    <p> Chemistry deals broadly with the study of matter. There are different aspects of chemistry in which  matter is studied. These arc Phvsical. Inorganic. Organic and Analytical.Physical Chemistry deals   with a wide variety of topics from the states of matter to the reaction rates. The modem approach to  chemistry is to deal with the following three aspects of matter.</p>
       <p>Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices, and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics and chemical equilibria.
      Physical chemistry, in contrast to chemical physics, is predominantly (but not always) a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which it was founded relate to the bulk rather than the molecular/atomic structure alone (for example, chemical equilibrium and colloids).</p>
  <h4>What do physical chemists do?</h4>
  <p>Physical chemists discover, test, and strive to understand the physical characteristics of a material (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas). Precision and attention to detail make their work somewhat similar to analytical chemistry.
They use sophisticated instrumentation and equipment such as lasers, mass spectrometers, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopes to: Analyze materials,Develop methods to test and characterize the properties of materials and Develop theories about these properties</p>

   
       <h3>Biochemistry</h3>
    <p> Biochemistry explores chemical processes related to living organisms. It is a laboratory-based science combining biology and chemistry. 
Biochemists study the structure, composition, and chemical reactions of substances in living systems and, in turn, their functions and ways to control them. Biochemistry emerged as a separate discipline when scientists combined biology with organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. They began to study areas such as How living things get energy from food, The chemical basis of heredity What fundamental changes occur in disease </p>
       <p>Biochemistry includes the sciences of molecular biology, immunochemistry, and neurochemistry, as well as bioinorganic, bioorganic, and biophysical chemistry.</p>
  <h4>What do biochemists do?</h4>
  <p>Biochemists interact with scientists from a wide variety of other disciplines, usually on problems that are a very small piece of a very large and complex system. Biochemists in industry are interested in specific applications that will lead to marketable products Biochemists in academia or government labs conduct more basic and less applied researchs</p>
